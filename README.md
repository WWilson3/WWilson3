The game takes place in at an upscale mansion hosting a dinner party. Ten party guests are all locked within and informed that one of them is there to murder the rest! Massacre Ball currently contains functional AI that:
- Has access to a list containing every goal in the game.
- Chooses a goal from that list based on game conditions.
- Chooses a location from that previously chosen goal.
- Moves to that location
- Performs tasks based on the chosen goal.
